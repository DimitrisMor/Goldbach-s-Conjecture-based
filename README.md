# Goldbach-s-Conjecture-based
A program based on Goldbach's conjecture.

Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and all of mathematics. 
It states that every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers. 
The specific program gives the possibility - opportunity to the user to input any even number in order to check if that number verifies the 
prominent Goldbach's conjecture. However, it does not focus only on that point, but it also prints all the possible combinations of the even 
numbers whose aggregate equals to the input number.
